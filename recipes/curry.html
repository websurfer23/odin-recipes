        <h1>Creamy Chickpea Coconut Curry</h1>

        <p>This one-pot curry is rich, comforting, and packed with plant-based protein.
            Chickpeas simmer in a fragrant coconut milk sauce infused with garlic, ginger, and warm spices.
            Itâ€™s a dish that feels both nourishing and luxurious, especially when served over fluffy rice or with warm naan.</p>
