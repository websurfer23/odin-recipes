        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This one-pan steak and vegetable dinner is a weeknight winner—juicy sirloin steak seared to perfection alongside crisp-tender broccoli, baby potatoes, and bell peppers, all 
            roasted with garlic and herbs for a rich, savory finish. The charred edges of the steak contrast beautifully with the caramelized vegetables, creating a balanced, nutrient-packed
            plate that’s as satisfying as it is simple. With minimal cleanup and maximum flavor, it’s a go-to for anyone craving comfort food with a fresh twist.</p>
